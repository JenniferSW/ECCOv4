# ECCO v4 r2

[This repository][] contains model settings ([code][], [input][]) and guidelines ([eccov4.pdf][]) which allow users to re-run ECCO v4 r2 using the [MITgcm][] and e.g. their on-premise cluster. An automated recipe for use with [Amazon Web Services' cfncluster][] is provided in [example_scipts][]. For user support, if needed, contact <mitgcm-support@mit.edu> or <ecco-support@mit.edu>.

**ECCO v4 r2** ([Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean][], version 4, release 2) is an ocean state estimate and solution of the MITgcm ([MIT general circulation model][]) that covers the period from 1992 to 2011 (Forget et al., 2016). It is a minor update of the original ECCO v4 solution (Forget et al., 2015) that benefits from a few additional corrections listed in Forget et al. (2016) and is easier to analyze and re-run. It is permanently archived via [this dataverse (follow link)][] and also distributed directly via [this ftp (follow link)][]
