# ECCO_v4_r2
This repository provides the model setup and directions (see eccov4.pdf) to re-run ECCO v4 r2 using MITgcm.

ECCO v4 r2 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, version 4, release 2; 
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ECCOv4r2) is an ocean state estimate and solution 
of the MITgcm (MIT general circulation model; http://mitgcm.org/) that covers the period 
from 1992 to 2011 (Forget et al., 2016). It is a minor update of the original ECCO v4 
solution (Forget et al., 2015) that benefits from a few additional corrections listed 
in Forget et al. (2016) and is easier to analyze and re-run.
