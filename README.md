ECCO v4 r2 ([Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean][], version 4, release 2) is an ocean state estimate and solution of the MITgcm ([MIT general circulation model][]) that covers the period from 1992 to 2011 (Forget et al., 2016). It is a minor update of the original ECCO v4 solution (Forget et al., 2015) that benefits from a few additional corrections listed in Forget et al. (2016) and is easier to analyze and re-run. It is permanently archived via dataverse @ <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ECCOv4r2> and available via ftp @ <ftp://mit.ecco-group.org/ecco_for_las/version_4/release2/>
